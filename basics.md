# Git Basics

* `git init` - creates a new git repository in the current folder
* `git status` - some text goes here but idk what it was supposed to say
* `git add` - missed this shit again
* `git commit` - 
* `git diff` - shows you the difference between your files (I think?)
* `git log` - idk
* `blah blah blah this is new`
